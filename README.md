# Code Metriker

Code metrics are often used to please the management.

The project started with an analysis of which metrics are helpful and which are
not. These metrics include Lines of Code because it represents a quantitative
progression. A really helpful metric is Cyclomatic Complexity, it helps to find
highly nested constructs. Besides this Metric, the functional length is not to
be neglected: small maintainable functions increase the overview and reduce
errors.
